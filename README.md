# FeelM
An online platform for sentiment analysis on movies

# To Continue The Project
1. Clone The Repository
2. Install all the packages in the reuirements.txt file
3. Set up the system variables that are required in the \_\_init\_\_ file (lines that have os.environ.get(...)) and the routes.py file, 
or replace them with passwords and API keys in the code itself (NOT RECOMENDED).
4. Install and create a PostgreSQL database. Then open a python console in the project directory, and type the followinf commands:
from server import db
db.create_all()

This should give you everything you need to continue the project. Enjoy! <br><br>
The current project is up and running on https://feelmsa.herokuapp.com/
